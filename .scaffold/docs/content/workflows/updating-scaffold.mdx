# Updating Scaffold

**Scaffold** differs from other project templates in that it is not only used
for a one-time project setup but also for ongoing maintenance. This means that
you can update **Scaffold** to the latest version at any time.

Once you the update process finishes, you will need to review the changes and
commit them to your project.

If you have modified any of the files that are provided by **Scaffold**,
the update process will override them, because **Scaffold** is not aware of the
changes you have made. You would need to manually accept or reject the new
changes.
