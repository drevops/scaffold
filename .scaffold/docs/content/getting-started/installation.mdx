## Updating

```shell title="Update to the latest version"
ahoy update-scaffold
```

```shell title="Update to the specific commit"
ahoy update-scaffold cb9979b2c10c59d52874be4661e9331b01d9b7c5
```

If you have modified any of the files that are managed by DrevOps Scaffold,
the update will override them. You would need to re-apply your changes.
This is because DrevOps Scaffold is not aware of the changes you have made
(and this is a good thing because you don't want to have your changes
overwritten by mistake without a proper review).
